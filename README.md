# memory-management-simulator

This project simulates in Java memory allocation from the moment a process arrives in the system to the moment it finishes execution and waits to be discarded. The simulation uses waiting queues, process queues and circular ready queues for processes who are getting CPU time.

Simulating different system configuarations can be done by adjusting simulation parameters such as:
- round robin time slot
- page size
- memory size
- number of parallel processes
- generation of custom processes
